# Car Software

This repository contains the tools to create a custom Raspberry Pi image that runs on a PiCarV. The software running in the image provides control over the PiCar and also streams video from the PiCar

## Features

- üêã Docker compose for reliability and orchestration
- ü§ñ Ansible to automate the setup process
- üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Raspberry Pi emulator for ease of development

## How it works

- We run the setup.py with python this starts the process
- This then builds a docker image containing Ansible, a automation system for setting up computers
- Now the script runs a docker compose file, this creates 2 docker containers (virtual machines)
- One of these contains our ansible instance, the other contains a Raspberry Pi emulator
- The docker compose file also networks these containers together so they can communicate
- Once the Pi Emulator has started ansible connects to it using ssh and automatically sets up the operating system
- Once Ansible has finished we can convert the `distro.qcow2` to a bootable image

## Dependencies

These need to be installed to use the program. You can use winget (windows) or apt-get (linux).

### [üêç Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

`winget install python3 -v 3.9.6150.0`

### [üêã Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

`winget install -e --id Docker.DockerDesktop`

### [üñ•Ô∏è QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/)

`winget install -e --id SoftwareFreedomConservancy.QEMU`

May need to be added to path if on Windows

## How to use

1. Clone or download the repository

`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/PiCarV/Car-Software.git`

2. Move into the Car-Software directory

`cd Car-Software`

3. Run the setup.py script

`python setup.py`

4. Monitor the process with Docker Desktop

Look for the stack called `car-software` you can click on the stack and you should see 2 containers inside. You can monitor the Ansible container, when it is done both containers should stop.

5. Create your final bootable image

`qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw dist/distro.qcow2 dist/distro.img`

A file called distro.img should appear, this can be booted on a Raspberry Pi
